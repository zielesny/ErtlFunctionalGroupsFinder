# ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder

### :warning:DISCLAIMER:warning:: This repository contains only legacy code! The project has been moved and is now available and maintained here: [JonasSchaub/ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder](https://github.com/JonasSchaub/ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder).

The algorithm for automated functional groups detection and extraction of organic molecules developed by Peter Ertl is implemented on the basis of the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK).<br/>
(Project team: Sebastian Fritsch, Stefan Neumann, Jonas Schaub, Christoph Steinbeck, Achim Zielesny).

Folder **Basic** contains the basic ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder code and test code for integration in Java projects (see instructions in *Basic usage instructions.txt*).

Folder **CDK** contains CDK library jar file *cdk-2.8.jar* that ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder works with.

Folder **Evaluation** contains sample code for evaluation of functional groups with ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder (see instructions in *Evaluation usage instructions.txt*).

Folder **JUnit 4** contains library jar files for unit testing.

Folder **Performance** contains a jar library for performance tests (see instructions in *Performance usage instructions.txt*).

Folder **Utility** contains code for filtering, preprocessing, and postprocessing routines useful for evaluation of functional groups with ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder (see instructions in *Utility usage instructions.txt*).

ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder is described in the scientific literature (see reference below).
<br>ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder is also available in the open Java rich client application MORTAR ('MOlecule fRagmenTation fRamework')
where <i>in silico</i> molecule fragmentation can be easily conducted on a given data set and the results visualised
([MORTAR GitHub repository](https://github.com/FelixBaensch/MORTAR), [MORTAR article preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-zgg8s)).

# Acknowledgments
The authors like to thank Peter Ertl for describing his algorithm in a way that allowed easy re-implementation. This is not always the case. We also thank him for valuable discussions. We appreciate help from Egon Willighagen and John Mayfield with the CDK integration and from Felix Bänsch for unbiased release testing.
